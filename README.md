If for some reason it asks you if you want to merge your changes,read what it is asking you and the changes it wants to merge and if they look alrigth approve the merge. If this causes a break we can always rool back the changes(albeit losing the new ones unless fixed)

Should you not want to use github desktop we're pobably going to be taught how to do it with the command line instead of with a desktop interface but i havent got time to write out the instructions on that here( and i dont think it would really benefit any of us now would it?)

Spelling,grammar and punctuation innacuracies are only for you amusement.
